```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. "ECAPA-TDNN model not found"**
```bash
# Install SpeechBrain properly
pip install speechbrain
# Restart Python session
```

**2. "CLAP model download failed"**
```bash
# Install with specific version
pip install laion-clap==1.1.4
```

**3. "Neural coreference not working"**
```bash
# Install neuralcoref correctly
pip install neuralcoref
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**4. "CUDA out of memory"**
```python
# Use CPU for large texts
pipeline = EnhancedVoiceScorePipeline(device="cpu")
```

**5. "Voice similarity matching returns empty results"**
```python
# Check embedding statistics
stats = engine.get_voice_analysis_report()
print(stats['embedding_stats'])
```

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Texts (>50,000 words):**
```python
# Process in chunks
pipeline = EnhancedVoiceScorePipeline(
    device="cuda",
    use_neural_coref=False,  # Disable for speed
    max_context_window=10    # Reduce memory usage
)
```

**For High-Quality Output:**
```python
# Maximum quality settings
pipeline = EnhancedVoiceScorePipeline(
    device="cuda",
    use_neural_coref=True,
    max_context_window=20,
    similarity_threshold=0.9
)
```
